I know it's a little messy, but here's the run-down:
Use Eclipse or your favorite IDE to edit the code.
If your IDE doesn't compile the code for you then use javac to compile everything in the src directory.
Run build_client.bat or build_server.bat depending on what you want to build.

That's about all there is to it!
